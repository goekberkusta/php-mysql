# php-mysql
School project in course CMPE341 database design and management merging mysql and php with phpmyadmin

To be able to run this project phpmyadmin and mysql must be set up. 
To connect the codes to phpmyadmin I installed xampp but there may be other variations.
The username and password for phpmyadmin is used default which are 'root' and ''.   
After starting xampp from localhost you should be able to diplay the test.php file on your browser.
